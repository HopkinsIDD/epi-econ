This repository provides the code for the Feedback-Informed Epidemiological Model (FIEM), which is introduced in the [pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.16.24317352v1):

Du, Zahn et al, "**Modeling dynamic disease-behavior feedbacks for improved epidemic prediction and response**", 2024 

To run the code, set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/epi-econ.git
cd epi-econ

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- **/src**: Contains the main source code for the FIEM.
- **/main.py**: Contains the code to run FIEM and base parameters.

More detailed instructions, documentation, and examples will be added soon.
